This is a simple project which checks if a person is eligible to drive. As we all know, those below the age of eighteen are underage, while those whose age ranges from eighteen to sixty are eligible to drive. People above the age of sixty are also not allowed to drive due to health and age related issues. I have used the If-Else ladder in this program
